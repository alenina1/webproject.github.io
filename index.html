                    longsuffering site&nbsp;www.cielparfum.com, which was 
                    incompetent programmer and once a 
                    month is constantly threatening to die, led me to the site 
                    and, eventually, to the guys from Drupal-coder. And it's been

                    Almost half a day goes by that I'm not surprised and happy with my luck! 
                    They fixed everything that didn't work - from search to displaying 
                    menus. We redesigned it - without deviating from the desired, but with 
                    essential and qualitative additions. 
                    We implemented a number of projects - contests, tests, etc. And so far 
                    of minor repairs and modifications - can't be counted! And the main thing - all 
                    high quality and fast (regardless of not the most "fast" 
                    tariff). If you have any questions - wonderful Alexey always 
                    prompt, support, repair and / or just 
                    do from scratch. There is an idea for implementation - 
                    wonderful Sergey will discuss and propose the perfect 
                    variant. There's a problem - the wonderful Nadezhda and Roman 
                    They will fix it, they will fix it and they will do it! The guys have proved that this CMS is 
                    powerful and competent management system. I hope that 
                    our collaboration will last for a long time! Thank you!!!

                    Over the years, our company has changed several 
                    teams of programmers and technical support specialists, and 
                    We are almost desperate to find an adequate professional offer in the Russian market 
                    professional offer at a reasonable price. Until 
                    we started working with the team of Initlab,

                    of a normal system of interaction combined with 
                    professional passion. For the first time in my

                    the most important tasks in the life of electronic media, even though 
                    that my colleagues work hundreds of miles away and we

                    recommendations for improving the software part of the site, 
                    Fixed a number of hidden bugs. I never write reviews
